# Foundry VTT packs

To simplify the creation of packs use this method:
1. Create a folder with the final name of the pack (ex: `my-pack.db`)
2. One entry in the pack is on `json` file in this folder

> You can create an `.html` file with save file name to replace content of the pack by HTML content.
