  <h2>Attunement</h2>
  Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn the item’s properties).

  If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails.

  Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.

        A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.
